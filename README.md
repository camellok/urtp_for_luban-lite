# urtp_for_luban-lite
URTP (USB Reliable Transport Protocol) is a universal protocol built upon the USB CDC protocol, specifically designed for the efficient transmission of large volumes of data. It facilitates file transfer, firmware updates, and image transmission between embedded devices and host computers.

This project is currently only compatible with the Luban-lite SDK of ArtInChip.
